Description: Manifolds are sets of vectors or matrices with additional constraints.
  This package provides functions to project points onto these manifolds, to generate
  random elements from a manifold or to walk along lines on the manifold. It implements
  these functions for Euclidean, Sphere, Rotation (SO(n)), symmetric positive definite (SPD),
  Grassmann, and Stiefel manifolds.
